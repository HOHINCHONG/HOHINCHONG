Exercise 3: Moon-te Carlo Methods 
A Monte Carlo method is an algorithm that approximates the area of a region by taking a large sample of uniformly distributed points over an area that covers that region, and evaluating the proportion of points that fall inside it.

For instance, consider the region bounded by the following condition:
This region is shown shaded in white in the plot below.

import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(-1, 1, 100)
y1 = (1-x**2)**0.5
y2 = -(1-x**2)**0.5

plt.plot(x, y1, color = 'white')
plt.plot(x, y2, color = 'white')
ax = plt.gca()
ax.axis('equal')
ax.set_facecolor('black')
ax.fill_between(x, y1, y2, facecolor = 'white')
plt.show()
